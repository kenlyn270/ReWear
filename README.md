# ReWear by Batikonika

ReWear is our solution for the **Sustainability** challenge:

> *"Sustainability isn’t just about the environment. It’s also about how we grow, adapt, and survive in a fast-changing world.  
> Indonesia needs to keep evolving to stay competitive and resilient, especially as businesses face new challenges brought by global shifts and rapid innovation.  
> Build a solution that helps businesses in Indonesia grow responsibly and stay adaptable, supporting long-term success without harming people or the planet."*

Did you know that producing just one cotton t-shirt can use up to **2,700 liters of water** and create around **2.1 kg of CO₂**?  
That’s why **ReWear** was born — to help fashion businesses address this challenge by integrating sustainability into their process.

ReWear offers two different views: one for **customers** and one for **admins**.

- Customers can send back used clothes they no longer wear (but still in good condition) and shop for unique upcycled products in the catalog.
- Admins get access to a dashboard to monitor submissions and confirm received items. The dashboard also shows real-time data on how much water and carbon emissions the company has saved.

AI is used to check if submitted clothes meet the company's recycle criteria. If an item doesn’t qualify, the AI suggests creative ways to reuse it.

This system is built with features fully delivered in Bahasa Indonesia, aligning with our primary target audience: local fashion businesses and organizations based in Indonesia.
